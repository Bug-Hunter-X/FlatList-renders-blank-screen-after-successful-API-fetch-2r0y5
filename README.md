# React Native FlatList Blank Screen Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native renders a blank screen even after successfully fetching data from an API. The issue is intermittent and appears inconsistently across different devices.

## Bug Description
The application fetches data from a remote API. The API call is successful, and the data is correctly parsed. However, the FlatList component does not render the fetched data. Instead, it shows a blank screen.  This bug seems to occur randomly on certain Android devices and emulators.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application on an Android device or emulator (the issue is less frequent on iOS).
3. Observe the FlatList component's behavior.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the `keyExtractor` function in the `FlatList` component is correctly implemented and that the data is correctly structured.  Additionally, thoroughly checking the API response for errors and handling them gracefully is critical.
